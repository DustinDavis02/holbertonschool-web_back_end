## ES6 Basics

In this project, we explore the basics of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015. Topics covered include `let` and `const`, arrow functions, template literals, default function parameters, destructuring assignment, classes, iterators, and for-of loops. We also cover software linters and their importance in maintaining code quality and consistency.
