# ES6 Promises

This directory contains various tasks for practicing with ES6 Promises in JavaScript.

## Tasks:
0. [0-promise.js](0-promise.js): Returns a Promise that is resolved after 10 milliseconds.
1. [1-promise.js](1-promise.js): Returns a Promise which either resolves to an object or rejects with an error message based on the input boolean parameter.
2. [2-then.js](2-then.js): Appends handlers to a Promise to handle both resolution and rejection scenarios.
3. [3-all.js](3-all.js): Uses `Promise.all` to collectively resolve multiple promises and log the results to the console.
4. [4-user-promise.js](4-user-promise.js): Returns a resolved promise with a user object.
5. [5-photo-reject.js](5-photo-reject.js): Returns a promise that always rejects with an error message.
6. [6-final-user.js](6-final-user.js): Uses `Promise.allSettled` to handle multiple promises and return their results in a specific format.
7. [7-load_balancer.js](7-load_balancer.js): Uses `Promise.race` to return the result of the promise that resolves first.
8. [8-try.js](8-try.js): Throws an error when trying to divide by zero.
9. [9-try.js](9-try.js): Uses a try-catch block to handle any errors that might occur during the execution of another function.
